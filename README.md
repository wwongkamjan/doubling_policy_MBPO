## Overview
doubling-policy MBPO

## Usage
> CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python main_mbpo.py --env_name 'HalfCheetah-v2' --num_epoch 400 --exploration True --exp_name halfcheetah_mbpo_0

> python draw_results.py

> jupyter notebook draw_render.ipynb

## code structure
During training, 'exp' folder will created aside 'wmbpo' folder.

## Dependencies
MuJoCo 1.5 & MuJoCo 2.0

## Reference
This code is based on a [previous paper in the NeurIPS reproducibility challenge](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkezvT9f6r) that reproduces the result with a tensorflow ensemble model but shows a significant drop in performance with a pytorch ensemble model. 
This code re-implements the ensemble dynamics model with pytorch and closes the gap.
